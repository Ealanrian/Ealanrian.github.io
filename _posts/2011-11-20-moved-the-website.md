As some might have notiched but hopefully no-one has I have moved the website to a new host. For some reasons I have decided to change host. Those reasons will be explained a little in the next part of this post.

So why have I changed host. Well I have been looking to go to one hosting company instead of the 2 I used to have, 1 for Jansman.eu/Ealanrian.nl and 1 for <a href="http://www.ghdev.nl/" target="_blank">GHDev.nl</a>. Last friday the hosting company for GHDev let me down by doing something to the database server making my site unreachable for over an hour. Well those things happen what triggerd my move was the fact that I wasn't told about it until 30 minutes into the down time.

The new company I am hosting on is <a href="http://Tilaa.nl" target="_blank">Tilaa.nl</a>. This is a dutch based company with some great service and excelent speed. So far I am very pleased with them. A full review on <a href="http://Tilaa.nl" target="_blank">Tilaa.nl</a>Â will be done in a few weeks.
