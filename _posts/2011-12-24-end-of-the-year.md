So nearing the end of the year. really can't understand where time went. What will I do next year to make more posts on the site? I'm going to figure out how to get hanze mail working in windowslive mail, write about Tilaa.nl my new host; I realy like it, Talk about Whisky my new found passion and probably will tell more about the Cave project I am working on and talk about my trip to Krak√≥w. So see you next year.
