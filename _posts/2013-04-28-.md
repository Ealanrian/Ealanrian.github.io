To complete my bachelor course in Computer science, I have to complete an internship. Since I wanted a challenging project and a project in an inspiring environment I ended up at a High tech company, which was surprisingly close to my home. Sadly the public transport system isn't very good in this part of the Netherlands so I bought my first car, but that's for another post. The internship assignment consisted of research into message systems and a part implementation. So far I have completed most of the research into message systems. In this post I'll talk about the message queue systems researched in this project and the different ways of working with messages they have.
