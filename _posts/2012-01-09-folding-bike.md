As some people might know I ride a folding bike. This is because it's free to take with you in the train and it's a lot quicker as riding the bus from the station to college.
My first folding bike was/is a Ventos folding bike as shown below. It's a prety good bike but after me abusing it for nearly 2 years now it starts to twist and bend.
Already had a broken securing pin and the chain tends to run of a lot.

The replacement:

It's a <a href="http://www.beixo.com/nl/compact" target="_blank">Beixo compact </a> a folding bike without a chain. It uses a cardan shaft to transfer the energy from the pedals to the wheel.
This should be a maintanance free system and also it is no longer possible to have a lose chain.
I'll probably get the Beixo this week and hope to review it next week.
