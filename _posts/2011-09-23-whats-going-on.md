So it has been quite here for a while. That's because I haven't had time to blog or when I had time there was no inspiration to blog.

So what have I been bussy with:
<ul>
	<li>Getting back to school and getting used to the ritme, not much to talk about there</li>
	<li>Started with the HonoursProgram and got my first project assigned, will talk about that later.</li>
	<li>Trying multiple Linux distro's also will talk more about this later.</li>
	<li>Trying to get some work for my business</li>
</ul>
<h3><!--more--><span>The honours program</span></h3>
<span>So I have started the honours program this year. We started with getting aÂ <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment" target="_blank">DISC assessment</a> of which the results will come in soon. After that we got projects assigned.
</span>The first project was a project for THIALF and basically was about getting the data from the skaters visible in diagrams. This is not the project I am working on.
The project I am working on is CAVE, Computer Aided Virtual Environment, the goal is to create an environment where demented elderly can relive memory's. More on this project in later blogs
<h3>Linux</h3>
I have been trying to make the switch to Linux and opensource software for a while now. I have tried Ubuntu but couldn't get satisfied with the interface. After that I tried Debian which I liked but thought it was to slow.
After that I tried Mandriva and Linuxmint. Those two I realy liked but I went for Linuxmint since it's so similar to Debian but alot lighter.

So thats it for today hope to have more soon
