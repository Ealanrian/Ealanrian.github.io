So this post has been waiting on me to write it since the 30th of may...
I have been thinking of making this post about a lot of things but instead
I will make a few more posts about those subjects. In this post I want to talk about
how the processes laid upon developers kill their passion and their creativity.<!--more-->

After reading this:

<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/process-kills-developer-passion.html" target="_blank">http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/05/process-kills-developer-passion.html</a>.

I started thinking about what was said in that article and how that applies to me.
During my study so far we have been taught a lot about the processes involving software development
but is software development really such a straightforward well defined business or is there more to it?

I think there is more to software development then just following rules. How can new software be made
without thinking outside the box, outside those rules given by all those processes.
